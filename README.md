🚶‍♀️✨ Traveling solo doesn’t mean being alone.
What if your phone could talk like a friend, guide like a local, and connect you to people around you — anywhere in the world?

Introducing a new kind of travel companion:
📍 See the world through your camera
🗣️ Ask locals or travelers nearby
🤖 And when no one’s there — AI answers like someone who gets you

Home is not a place. It’s a feeling.
And soon, you can take it with you. 🌍
